<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal BVS</li><li>Polymer BVS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) market is primarily divided into two types: metal BVS and polymer BVS. Metal BVS typically utilizes biodegradable metallic materials like magnesium or iron, providing temporary structural support while gradually dissolving in the body. In contrast, polymer BVS is made from biocompatible polymers that also degrade over time, promoting vessel healing without leaving long-term foreign materials. Both types aim to restore vascular function and reduce complications associated with permanent stents, enhancing patient recovery.</p></p>
