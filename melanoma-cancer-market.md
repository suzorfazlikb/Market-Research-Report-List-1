<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Melanoma Cancer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive melanoma</li><li>Invasive melanoma</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The melanoma cancer market is divided into two main types: non-invasive melanoma and invasive melanoma. Non-invasive melanoma, often identified as in situ melanoma, includes early-stage cancers that have not penetrated deeper layers of the skin, making them easier to treat and often resulting in better outcomes. Invasive melanoma, on the other hand, extends beyond the epidermis into deeper skin layers, presenting a higher risk and requiring more aggressive treatment options such as surgery, immunotherapy, or targeted therapies.</p></p>
